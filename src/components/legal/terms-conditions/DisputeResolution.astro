      As limited by the FAA, these Terms of Use and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and
      jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is
      arbitral, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator
      does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms of Use. The
      arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type
      of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. Notwithstanding anything to
      the contrary herein or the applicable AAA Rules, discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to one set of interrogatories, one set of
      requests for admissions, and one set of requests for production of documents.

    <p>
      The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and
      amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
      claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. You agree that the party that
      prevails in arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
