     constitutes the entire agreement between you and Complete Farmer and
    supersedes any prior agreements between you and Complete Farmer with respect
    to the subject matter herein. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right
    or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or
    provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of
    competent jurisdiction to be invalid, we both nevertheless agree that the
    court should endeavor to give effect to our intentions as reflected in this
    provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement to remain in full
    force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
    contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of
    our Website or App or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after
    such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A party’s failure
    to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a
    waiver of the party’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar
    breaches. All the sections intended to survive the termination of this
    Agreement shall survive. The section titles in this Agreement are for
    convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as
    explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Complete Farmer shall be given
    by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested at
    Completefarmer Technologies Inc., 03 Abeasi Street, Accra, Ghana. Any
    notices to you shall be provided to you through our Website or App or given
    to you via the email address or physical address you provide to Complete
    Farmer during the registration process.
